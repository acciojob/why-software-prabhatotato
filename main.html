      <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
      <p>
        I am drawn to development because progress is something you can build,
        not wait for. Writing code demands patience, precision, and the
        willingness to sit with problems until they make sense. I value learning
        deeply rather than moving quickly, and I find satisfaction in improving
        through steady, deliberate effort. Development appeals to me because it
        rewards consistency, and each step forward is visible in what gets built.
